| \|\|     | OR          |

## Assignment Operators
| Operator | Example     |

| =        | a = 5       |
| +=       | a += 3 (a = a + 3) |
| -=       | a -= 2      |

# Increment & Decrement Operator

- Post-Increment (```v++```)
- Pre-Increment (```++v```)
- Post-Decrement (```v--```)
- Pre-Decrement (```--v```)
